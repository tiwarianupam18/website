                <ul class="goalstyle">
                    Stress management is the practice of understanding and controlling stress to maintain a balanced
                    life. It involves adopting coping strategies, relaxation techniques, and lifestyle adjustments. By
                    identifying stressors and implementing effective measures, it aims to reduce the negative impact of
                    stress on mental, emotional, and physical well-being. Ultimately, it promotes resilience and a
                    healthier, more harmonious way of living.
